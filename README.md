# ChallengeSolutions

This is a small, yet growing, collection of solutions I've come up with for various coding challenges. I'm making this to 1) have an organized collection of my solutions, 2) force myself to explain my solutions, ensuring that I actually know what's going on, and 3) to continully come back to after time to see if/how I would do these differently. :dancer:
